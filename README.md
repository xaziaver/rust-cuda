# Rust-CUDA Interface for MoE Layer Optimization

## Introduction
This repository is an educational project aimed at learning about CUDA programming and developing a Rust-CUDA interface specifically tailored for creating custom kernels to optimize the Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer in large language models (LLMs).

The goal is to create a minimal and focused Rust-CUDA interface that provides the necessary functionality to write and launch custom CUDA kernels for the MoE layer, enabling efficient and optimized computation on NVIDIA GPUs.

## Project Outline
To develop the Rust-CUDA interface, the following steps will be taken:

1. **Setup and Environment**:
   - Install Rust and the necessary development tools.
   - Set up the CUDA Toolkit and ensure it is properly configured.
   - Create a new Rust library project for the Rust-CUDA interface.

2. **CUDA API Bindings**:
   - Identify the CUDA APIs required for the custom kernels.
   - Create Rust bindings for the necessary CUDA APIs using FFI (Foreign Function Interface).
   - Implement safe Rust wrappers around the CUDA API bindings to provide a more idiomatic Rust interface.

3. **Memory Management**:
   - Implement Rust structs and methods for managing GPU memory allocation and deallocation.
   - Provide functions for transferring data between the CPU and GPU.
   - Ensure proper cleanup and resource management.

4. **Kernel Launching**:
   - Define Rust functions for launching CUDA kernels.
   - Implement the necessary Rust code to configure and launch kernels with the appropriate parameters.
   - Handle kernel launch errors and provide meaningful error messages.

5. **Synchronization and Error Handling**:
   - Implement synchronization primitives to ensure proper execution order and data consistency.
   - Add error handling mechanisms to catch and propagate CUDA errors.
   - Provide Rust-friendly error types and messages.

6. **Integration and Testing**:
   - Write Rust code that utilizes the developed Rust-CUDA interface to perform basic operations on the GPU.
   - Compile and run the Rust code to verify the functionality of the interface.
   - Test the interface with different input sizes and configurations to ensure correctness and performance.

7. **Incremental Development**:
   - Identify additional features and functionalities needed for the custom MoE kernels.
   - Incrementally extend the Rust-CUDA interface to support these features.
   - Repeat the integration and testing process for each new feature added.

8. **Documentation and Examples**:
   - Provide clear and concise documentation for the Rust-CUDA interface, including usage guidelines and API references.
   - Include example code snippets and tutorials demonstrating how to use the Rust-CUDA interface for common tasks.
   - Document any limitations, performance considerations, or best practices when using the interface.
